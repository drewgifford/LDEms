<p>I have almost forgot the taste of fears;<br/>
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd<br/>
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair<br/>
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir<br/>
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;<br/>
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts<br/>
Cannot once start me.</p>
<p>
She should have died hereafter;<br/>
There would have been a time for such a word.<br/>
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,<br/>
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day<br/>
To the last syllable of recorded time,<br/>
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br/>
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br/>
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player<br/>
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage<br/>
And then is heard no more: it is a tale<br/>
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br/>
Signifying nothing.<br/>
